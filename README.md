# 2048masterbot

**IN PROGRESS.** Bot for [https://2048game.online/](https://2048game.online/).

**Built:** board engine, move simulation, evaluation.
**Not built:** solver, browser driver, benchmark harness.

Repo: [https://github.com/HMAC10/2048masterbot](https://github.com/HMAC10/2048masterbot)

## 1. Why this repo exists

Most 2048 bots target Gabriele Cirulli's original open-source game, which exposes DOM tiles and predictable state. This bot targets [https://2048game.online/](https://2048game.online/), a Phaser canvas game that reuses the original's page copy. Existing bots do not work against it.

## 2. How it works

Four-step loop:

1. Read the board
2. Choose a move
3. Press an arrow key
4. Wait for the board to change

Choosing uses **expectimax**: on the bot's turn take the best of the four directions; on the game's turn take the probability-weighted average over every possible tile spawn (90% a 2, 10% a 4). Leaf boards are scored by board health, not points.

## 3. Architecture

`board.py` and `solver.py` have zero browser dependency. They operate on a single integer board. That is what allows offline benchmarking at full speed. Browser I/O (Playwright) stays in a separate driver layer and is not required to test move logic or search.

## 4. Board representation

A board is one 64-bit Python `int`: 16 cells × 4 bits. Each cell stores **log2** of the tile value (`empty=0`, tile `2→1`, `4→2`, …, `32768→15`).

Cell `(row r, col c)` occupies the 4 bits starting at bit position `60 - (r*16 + c*4)`. `(0,0)` is the highest nibble; `(3,3)` is the lowest. Row 0 is the top row; col 0 is the left column.

At import time `board.py` builds four 65536-entry row lookup tables:

| Table | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `ROW_LEFT` | row after slide/merge left |
| `ROW_RIGHT` | row after slide/merge right |
| `SCORE` | points gained from merges on a left move of that row |
| `HEUR` | row health score used by `evaluate()` |

Up/down reuse the left/right tables via `transpose()`. `evaluate(board)` sums `HEUR` over the four rows of the board and the four rows of its transpose (columns), which produces corner anchoring without an explicit corner term.

## 5. Site reverse-engineering notes

Found by diagnostic probing (not encoded as constants in the engine):

| Fact | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Engine | Phaser, rendering to canvas |
| DOM tiles | none; `.tile-container` does not exist |
| State key | `localStorage['phaser2048_game_state']` |
| Shape | `{"grid": [[...]], "score": 0, "won": false, "keepPlaying": false}` |
| Tile values | raw (`2`, `4`, `1024`), not log2 |
| `grid[0]` | top row |
| `grid[r][0]` | left column |
| Writes | on every move that changes the board; no-ops do not write |
| Arrow keys | register only after clicking the canvas for focus |

`won` and `keepPlaying` arrive in the same read as the board, which makes the win overlay easy to detect. Bots that miss it cap out around 20,000 points because the game stops accepting input at 2048.

## 6. Setup

Python 3.10+.

```bash
python -m venv .venv
```

Windows (PowerShell):

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

macOS / Linux:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
playwright install chromium
```

## 7. Usage

```bash
pytest
python live_board.py
```

`live_board.py` watches parsed board state while you play manually. The bot itself is not runnable yet.

## 8. Roadmap

- [x] Site reverse-engineering
- [x] Bitboard
- [x] Move simulation validated against naive reference
- [x] Evaluation function
- [ ] Expectimax with adaptive depth
- [ ] Offline benchmark harness
- [ ] Playwright driver
- [ ] Empirical weight tuning
- [ ] Optional canvas vision adapter

## 9. Testing approach

`board.py` ships `naive_move`, a deliberately slow nested-list implementation. The suite asserts both paths agree across 2000 random boards in all four directions. Bit-manipulation bugs are silent: they do not raise; they just make the bot play slightly wrong moves that are nearly impossible to diagnose from outside.

The bitboard-plus-lookup-table architecture and heuristic shape follow [nneonneo/2048-ai](https://github.com/nneonneo/2048-ai). Weight starting values are informed by [qpwoeirut/2048-solver](https://github.com/qpwoeirut/2048-solver). No code was copied from either.
